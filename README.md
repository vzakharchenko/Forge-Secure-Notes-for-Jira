# Forge-Secure-Notes-for-Jira

[![Node.js CI](https://github.com/vzakharchenko/Forge-Secure-Notes-for-Jira/actions/workflows/node.js.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/vzakharchenko/Forge-Secure-Notes-for-Jira/actions/workflows/node.js.yml)
Share sensitive information securely within Jira issues. Create one-time, expiring encrypted notes with out-of-band key exchange. Built with Atlassian Forge, Custom UI &amp; @forge/sql, @forge/kvs.

## 🧠 About the Project

### Inspiration

"Secure Notes for Jira" was inspired by a common challenge faced by many teams: the need to share sensitive information — such as access credentials, API keys, private feedback, or temporary passwords — directly within a Jira issue, without exposing it in issue fields, comments, or descriptions.

While Jira excels at task tracking and collaboration, it lacks a secure, ephemeral channel for confidential communication. This app bridges that gap by providing a secure mechanism for sharing notes that are:

- Confidential
- Time-limited
- Verifiably read by the intended recipient
- Automatically deleted after viewing

### 🔒 Security Features

- 🔐 Create encrypted notes on Jira issues
- 🕒 Choose an expiration: 1 hour, 1 day, 7 days, 10 days
- 🔑 Generate a one-time decryption key (created by user, never stored on backend - only the user knows the key)
- 📥 View received notes (with key)
- 📤 View and delete sent notes
- 🧨 Note self-destructs after reading or upon expiry
- ⏳ Expiration is enforced automatically using a Forge `scheduledTrigger`
- 👤 Only the designated Atlassian account can decrypt the Secure Note
- 📧 **Email Notifications**: Automatic email notifications are sent:
  - When a secure note is created and shared with you
  - When a secure note expires and is automatically deleted
  - When a secure note is manually deleted by the creator

### 🖥 UI Features

- 📎 Open decryption links directly from the Issue Panel or via email
- 🧭 Support for routing and deep-linking to global pages
- ⏱️ 5-minute countdown timer during note viewing
- 🌓 Full dark/light mode support based on Jira theme
- 👥 Multiple recipients support - send secure notes to multiple users at once
- 📝 Description field for better note organization and tracking
- 📊 Comprehensive audit pages with detailed history tracking:
  - **My History**: View your personal secure notes history with pagination
  - **My Issue History**: Browse notes by issue with detailed audit trails
  - **My Project History**: View notes organized by project
  - **User History**: Admin-only view of all users' secure notes
- 📈 Expandable status history showing CREATED, VIEWED, DELETED, and EXPIRED events
- 📥 CSV Export functionality on all audit pages for data analysis
- 🔄 Automatic background polling (every 10 seconds) for real-time updates
- 📋 Modern table UI using Atlassian Design System components
- 🤖 **Rovo AI Agent** - Natural language analytics for Security Notes data

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### Architecture

- **Frontend:** React + Vite (Forge Custom UI)
- **Backend:** Forge Functions using `@forge/api`, `@forge/sql`, `@forge/kvs`
- **ORM:** [forge-sql-orm](https://github.com/vassio/forge-sql-orm)
- **AI Analytics:** Atlassian Rovo AI agent for natural language queries
- **Storage:**
  - Encrypted content in `@forge/kvs` (via `setSecret`)
  - Metadata in `@forge/sql`

### Security Design

- **Client-side encryption** using Web Crypto API
- **AES-GCM** with 32-byte key derived via PBKDF2
- **Encryption key security:**
  - The encryption key is **generated by the user** and **never stored on the backend**
  - Only the user who creates the key knows it
  - Backend stores only `encryption_key_hash` (hash of the key) for validation purposes
  - The actual encryption key is required for decryption and must be shared out-of-band
- **Split data model for decryption:**
  - Half of the decryption data is with the user: **encryption key** (known only to the user)
  - Other half is in metadata: **IV** (Initialization Vector) and **salt** stored in `@forge/sql`
  - Both parts are required to decrypt the content
- Random IV generation for each message
- Encrypted content stored in `@forge/kvs.setSecret`
- Metadata (IV, salt, encryption_key_hash) stored in `@forge/sql`
- Out-of-band key exchange required (key must be shared separately via secure channel)
- Automatic content deletion after viewing

## 📝 Usage Guide

### Creating a Secure Note

1. Open any Jira issue
2. Click on the "Secure Notes" panel
3. Click "Create New Secure Note"
4. Fill in the required fields:
   - **Select recipients**: Choose one or multiple users who can decrypt the note
   - **Description**: Enter a description of what you're sharing (required)
   - **Your Secure Note**: Enter the secret message content (max 10KB recommended)
   - **Set Note Expiry**: Choose expiration time (1 hour, 1 day, 7 days, 10 days, or custom date)
5. Click "Generate New Key" to create an encryption key
6. Copy the encryption key and share it securely (via Slack, email, etc.)

8. **Email Notification**: The recipient(s) will automatically receive an email notification with:
   - A direct link to access the secure note
   - The expiration date and time
   - Instructions on how to obtain the decryption key
9. The note will be automatically updated in the panel every 10 seconds via background polling

### Viewing a Secure Note

1. Open the secure note link (from email notification or issue panel)
2. Enter the decryption key
3. View the message content
4. Use "Copy and Close" to save the content and destroy the note
5. The note will be automatically destroyed after viewing or when expired

### Email Notifications

The application automatically sends email notifications for important events:

1. **When a Secure Note is Created**:
   - Recipients receive an email with subject "🔐 A security note has been shared with you"
   - The email includes a direct link to access the note
   - The expiration date and time are clearly displayed
   - Instructions on how to obtain the decryption key are provided

2. **When a Secure Note Expires**:
   - Recipients receive an email with subject "⚠️ A Secure Note has expired and was deleted"

### Rovo AI Analytics

The application includes a **Rovo AI agent** that enables natural language queries about Security Notes data. Users can ask questions in plain English, and the agent will generate and execute SQL queries to provide insights.

**Features:**

- Ask questions like:
  - "Show all users which I shared security notes with for this issue"
  - "Show my notes for this issue from last week"
  - "Prepare a report of all descriptions and who shared for this issue last month"
  - "Show top 10 users who created the most security notes"

**Security:**

- Only read-only SELECT queries are allowed
- Queries must target only the `security_notes` table (no JOINs, subqueries, or references to other tables)
- JOIN operations are automatically detected and blocked using EXPLAIN query plan analysis
- Window functions (e.g., `COUNT(*) OVER(...)`) are not allowed and are automatically detected and blocked
- Non-admin users can only see notes they created or received
- Admin users have full access to all notes
- Sensitive fields are protected:
  - **Encryption key**: Never stored on backend, only known to the user who created it
  - **encryption_key_hash**: Stored for validation only (cannot be used to decrypt)
  - **IV and salt**: Stored in metadata but useless without the encryption key
  - These fields are never exposed in Rovo queries or any API responses
- Row-level security is enforced automatically
- Security columns (`created_by`, `target_user_id`) must be selected as raw columns for proper access control

**How to use:**

1. Open the Rovo AI assistant in Jira
2. Ask questions about Security Notes using natural language
3. The agent will generate SQL queries and return results
4. Results are explained in natural language with summaries and highlights

**Example queries:**

- "Can you show all users which I shared security notes with for this issue?"
- "Show all users which I shared security notes with for this project."
- "Report security notes for this issue last month."
- "Show me top 10 users who created the most security notes."
