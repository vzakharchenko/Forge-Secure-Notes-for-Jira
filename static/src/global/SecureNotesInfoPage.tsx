            <h1>üîê Secure Notes for Jira</h1>
            <p>
                Secure Notes allows Jira users to share encrypted messages with specific teammates,
                linked directly to Jira issues.
            </p>

            <h2>üîß How it works</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>You select a user and write a secure note on the issue panel.</li>
                <li>The note is encrypted in the browser with a unique key.</li>
                <li>A special link is generated and shared via a Jira notification.</li>
                <li>Only the selected recipient can view the note with the decryption key.</li>
                <li>The key is not stored on the server ‚Äî you must send it via Slack, email, or other secure methods.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>‚è≥ Expiry & Privacy</h2>
            <p>
                Notes automatically expire after a defined period (e.g., 1 hour). Expired or viewed notes are marked accordingly.
            </p>

            <h2>‚úÖ Why use Secure Notes?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep sensitive information (like credentials or private instructions) out of comments.</li>
                <li>Ensure that only the intended recipient can decrypt and access the note.</li>
                <li>No passwords are stored ‚Äî it's a zero-trust approach.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>üöÄ Ready to use</h2>
            <p>
